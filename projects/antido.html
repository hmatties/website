        <h4 class="special5">Our current digital connections are plagued by deceit, showmanship, and misrepresentation.</h4>
        <p class="pplus">The current ecosystem of social platforms have failed us, and their ever-present drawbacks have begun unravel the fabric of our societies. These drawbacks have contributed to the alarming uptick in the prevalence of major depression and suicide in adolescent groups, the growing dependency on connection, and the volatile role technology has played in our political and media systems. </p>

        <p>This drastic problem facing us pushed me to consider how we might rethink our modern digital connections for the better.</p>

        <p>Given the timeline and scope of the project, in-depth quantitative research was not going to be a feasible component of this project. A majority of inspiration and reserach behind Antido lied within the cultural signifiers, lived experiences, and conversations ive had with those in my demographic.</p>

            <h3>Social Media Privatization</h3>
            <p class="pplus">As modern social platforms have continued to cement their place in culture over the past decade, we have seen subcultures and novel usages spread throughout user-bases. A key one I observed was users beginning to supplement their public persona with more honest, private ones.</p>

        <div id="section2" class="content">

            <p>This advent began with “Finsta’s”, otherwise know as fake instagrams. These accounts allowed users too easily reach a smaller circle of friends with content that was more realistic and honest. Since this style of usage began to take off, we have seen major platforms formally adopt them. Snapchat introduced private stories, instagram brought in ‘close friends’, and across the industry most companies adopted more malleable privacy settings. </p>

            <p class="pplus">This discovery pushed me to consider how we could not only design for these kind of digital relationships, but consider how we can enhance them as well.</p>

                <h3 class="special">Great designers are genre-less</h3>
                <p>Antido was my first exploration into the world of digital product design. I worried how my skills would and wouldn’t transfer, but this project taught me that medium is meaningless. My value and skills as a designer lie in my ability to understand, synthesize, ideate, and implement. The tools used to do this are, and will continue to be, flexible. I learned removing the genres and expectations of output provided me the oppurtunity to do what I as a designer should be doing, solving a problem. </p>

                <p>When evaluating competitors in this market I noticed an alarming trend of companies and platforms each seeking to build products that envelop all communication. I beleive this panoptic view of their roles in the world strip the product of its novelty and value. Though it may provide flexibility to the user, I believe the lack of focus can be very overwhelming for users at times. This insight really showed me the value in finding your lane, and staying in it.</p>

                <p>A major focus for this project was to communicate the visual motifs and identity of the product through animation. This facet of Antido really highlighted the value tools like animation, and design tools in general, truly have. I learned all these tools are simply modes of communication, and their amalgamation and composition work to paint a cohesive picture of the idea you are seeking to communicate. This insight really changed the way I looked at my design education, holistically. I began to see the skills I was building as tools within my ‘tool kit’. Regardless of the project or medium, I have a slew of tools at my disposal that I can utilize the effectively communicate my ideas, and I should never assume what may or may not be necessary to effectively communicate my ideas.</p>
