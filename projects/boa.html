                <p class="pplus">Designing anything requires a starting point, a seed of inspiration that allows you a platform to build upon. Here we looked at some of the most meaningful and inspiring things one might carry with them; our favorite places, songs, and films. Our ideation was structued. We were asked to develop ten core ideas, or concepts, from each source which would then be evaluated, expanded upon, and assessed for their value in the project.</p>

                    <p class="pplus">With having identified key sources to inspire my piece, we quickly ideated around each. Through weeks of concepting we being the narrow our focus of concepts and sources. Through this ideation process I chose to focus on a piece of music, specifically: First Love / Late Spring by Mitski.</p>

                    <p>This song reminded me of so much, but specifically, a certain person, and a past love. The memories with this song and artist were incredibly vivid, and the attatchment to this person further fueled the conceptual focus of this phase.</p>

The second key detail was the addition of the lip on the shoe carriage. This lip provides extra support for the tower, and provides a unqiue visual 'echo' between the bench and tower.</p>

                <p>This initial phase of production required a lot of on-the-spot problem solving. Jig making, form refinement, and material shifts were all essential in the process. Boa's base shape is made from maple plywood and 1/4 rounds, seamed together with oak splines.</p>

                    <p>Every person carries with them their own experiences that provide unique insights and perspectives on the world around them, and designers are no exception. By seeking anonymity in your work, you rid design of its humanity. Good design is not arbitrary, it encompasses a thorough utilization of inspiration, research, iteration, and craft. Regardless of medium, each step in the this process provides us designers an opportunity to highlight our individuality and leave our fingerprint.</p>

                    <p>Many projects, like boa, present a multitude of challenges to accomplish a single goal. Within projects like these, I learned that organization and compartmentalization are key to allow each piece of the puzzle fit together well. Throughout this project I sought to find isolated components that could be explored in smaller environments. This allowed me to not only save time, but also allowed me to for-see facets of the project that pose more of a challenge than others. By approaching challenges in this way, I was able to create a more polished final project and simultaneously provide myself the ability to speak to the combination and interaction of these features in a more alluring way. </p>

                    <p>Long term projects like this one often bring with them a long list of expectations regarding output, timeline, and challenges at their inception. Designing and building Boa taught me to forgo all of these preconceived conclusions. These challenges throughout the project altered my timeline,  my craft, and even the form of Boa. These challenges not only helped me grow as a designer, but allowed the project itself to visually evolve in ways I never thought possible. Boa not only taught me to account for these challenges, but to embrace them. </p>
