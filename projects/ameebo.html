                <p>To fully understand the facets of play and how they may or may not affect childhood development, we first need to understand the framework in which play is categorized. These categorizations can help indicate the components of certain activities that may have a more unique cognitive interaction. Though there are a wide variety of ways in which some have categorized play, we will work with the broader framework outlined below.</p>

                <p class="pplus">Given the product market I was studying was already so developed, I had a lot of freedom to target my testing and research to more niche areas of play that would influence my process. Here I chose to focus on the concept of abstraction, and sought to recognize how children in this age demographic understand, handle, and utilize a lack of context in play.</p>

                <img id="center3" src="../images/ameebo/testing2.jpg" alt="me administering test">


                <p>The test I designed sought to verify that children can create their own context within ambiguity. This test provided kids with a sheet of paper with a simple random pen stroke through the middle of the page, hundreds of these pages were prepared before hand. The kids were then asked to help me ‘finish’ all my drawings. The goal here was to see what they might see in a single stroke, and what kind of world they might build around this ambiguity.</p>

Using this functionality as my starting point made form development quite easy, and Ameebo’s final form resulted from iterative testing to manage the proper amount of cavities and attachment points, as to provide a simple, yet engaging, experience for users.</p>

                <P>Ameebo allows kids to therapeutically twist and tie Ameebo into new shapes that can create pillows, characters, or whatever their imagination might manifest. </P>

                <p class="pplus">Ameebo’s prototyping process was two-fold. I not only had to prototype the form and interactions that the final piece would embody, but simultaneously, I had to learn to sew. </p>

                <p> To ideate around Ameebo’s final form, upholstery foam was used to carve out scaled models. At a larger scale, I was producing variations of the interaction points with cotton fabric and polyester stuffing.</p>

                    <p>This project was my first true experience with design. It encompassed in-depth user research, iterative ideation, testing, and high fidelity production. Within this process I took many, many risks. I didn’t know how to sew, I was unsure of the effectiveness of my research, I worried about the clarity of my work, and more. But what this project provided for me was an opportunity to push myself. Every step I could, I set the bar for myself just out of reach, and it taught me that I am the kind of designer and person that rises to the occasion.</p>

I learned that you can’t take a user’s frustrations at face value. But rather, you have to uncover the motivations and struggles that lie under the surface. Synthesizing research is a key step in the design process that I learned to love, because it provides an opportunity for a designer to highlight their individual problem solving ability.</p>

                    <p>Working in this industry and product category really showed me what’s wrong in the product design industry, complacency. We focus on maintaining marketability and familiarity rather than prioritizing innovation. In a sense, we have prioritized profits over the well-being of our users, and in the process, we’ve devalued the role of the designer. This is in no way a novel insight, but it did show me that there is a vast amount of progress to be made, even in industries that have been established for centuries.</p>
