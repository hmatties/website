            <p class="pplus">In large national elcetions we tend to see participation around 60%. That number, however, drastically drops when looking at local elections. Nationally,  only 15-27% of eligable voters participate in local elections.  </p>

            <p>Along with the general lack of participation, this phenomena is only worsened as we assess participation by age demographic. Less than half of all voters between the ages of 18-29 participated in the most recent election, coming in at an average of 19 points below older demographics. </p>

                <p>The design process valued clarity over anything else. Not only was the topic itself extremely dense, but the content was also subject to misrepresentation as we have seen through other media outlets. This phase of the product utilized every tool possible, including information architecture, building user flows, rounds of wireframing, and information architecture testing.</p>

                    <p>Once I had built a concise information hierarchy, and thought through management of key content throughout the site, I was then able to begin building wireframes.

                    <p>Through rounds of iteration covering information architecture, wire framing, testing, component building, and visual design our team was ready to create an in-depth visualization of the application to show how it may navigate for a user. This prototype was built using Figma’s interactive prototyping features.</p>

                        <p>Especially when working with this type of information, it’s important to remember that content is king. I found through this process that often the hierarchy and relationships between content shows a pattern that helps you clearly understand how content should be displayed. </p>

                            <p>Multidisciplinary projects often require a lot of back and forth, but I found especially in this hybrid work model we see today, it is more important than ever to utilize all the communication tools available to you. Not only are video call tools great for this, but asynchronous tools like Slack and Figma allow team members to communicate without face time.</p>

                                <p>Data is essential for any modern web tool. This is something I was aware of before this project, but my understanding of its relationship to design shifted in this project. A key thing I realized is that this implementation and integration of data is essential to consider in the early steps of a project, as the usage and sourcing of it can, and should, alter the representation of content within the product.</p>
