            <p>The core of Gami’s research lied in two distinct places. One, being the fundamentals of computational design, specifically, parametricism. The other core research category lied in understanding traditional origami practices, this required a lot of hand and scaled modeling to understand how rigid structure could be created from 2D patterns.</p>

                <h2>Utilizing a Parametric Methodology</h2>
                <p class="pplus">Traditional computational methods, like generative design, rely on code to drive the form of an object. Gami utilizes a parametric ideology which allows designers to make overarching changes to their design in real-time.  </p>
    
                <img id="center" src="../images/gami/Parametric.svg" alt="parametric visualization">
    
                <p>This parametric methodology allowed me to maintain my control over the form of Gami, while also being able to easily manipulate the scale and fit of whatever form factor the user might desire. This computational usage represents one component of Gami’s creation. Parametric design was primarily used here to facilitate the production of the many offshoots and form factors Gami can take. The other primary ideation method revolved around origami inspired direct modeling to discern the form that Gami would take.</p>

        <p>Building Gami’s script required a basic understanding of object-oriented programming, and a deep understanding of the underlying geometry and trigonometry that builds the form of Gami. Utilizing mathematical syntax was essential to allow Gami to truly act parametrically.</p>

All these relationships are based on the initial bounding box, which is defined by the user, or preset standardized sizes. From there, all the panels and lid are then built to fit and fold perfectly. At certain checkpoints throughout the script the designer can intervene to account for various manufacturing constraints.</p>
