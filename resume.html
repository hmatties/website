                <p>Each year, IDSA recognizes exceptional student design talent through the Undergraduate Student Merit Awards program. The competition highlights the very best creativity, problem solving, and design brilliance across each of IDSA's five Design Districts. One IDSA student member winner is selected from each district for this prestigious distinction. SMA judging consists of two rounds. Round 1 is conducted by each school and determines a single Student Finalist for that program. Only these Student Finalists participate in round 2. Round 2 is conducted entirely online by IDSA and determines the 5 SMA District Winners. In 2021, I was selected by faculty to represent JMU at the district level.</p>
